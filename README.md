## 🖥️ Desktop Polish

This project is tuned for a desktop website layout. To adjust container width, typography, and grid columns for large screens, tweak the desktop media queries in style.css.

Key variables to adjust:
- --container-max: overall content width
- font-size scale: --fs-md, --fs-lg, --fs-xl, etc.
- Grid columns: .features-grid, .cards, .stats-grid

Tip: For 4-column layouts on large screens:
- .features-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
- .cards { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
- .stats-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }
